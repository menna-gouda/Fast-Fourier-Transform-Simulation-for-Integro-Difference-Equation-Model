# Simulation-of-an-integro-difference-model-with-a-diffusion-kernel
This repository contains the code for solving an integro-difference equation model that has a diffusion kernel using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Four diffusion kernels were proposed in integral form and Laplace's method was used to approximate those integrals. For parameter estimation, kernels were fit using Maximum Likelihood Estimation while Bayesian Information Criterion was calculated for kernel competition.
