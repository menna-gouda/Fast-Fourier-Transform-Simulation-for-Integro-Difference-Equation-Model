# Simulation-of-an-integro-difference-model-with-a-diffusion-kernel

# About
This repository hosts the code for solving an integro-difference equation model featuring a diffusion kernel using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques. The model involves the integration of four proposed diffusion kernels in integral form, with Laplace's method employed to approximate these integrals. Parameter estimation is carried out through Maximum Likelihood Estimation, and Bayesian Information Criterion is calculated for kernel competition.
